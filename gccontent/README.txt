The code needs to be compiled before it is run. This has to be done from terminal, either on the CSC Unix machines (CentOS), or on a Mac.

 - You first need to navigate to the directory (folder) containing the files (Likely to be in your Downloads directory).

 - After navigating to the appropriate directory, you'll need to first compile the code (contained in the .java file):
        Run this from the terminal:  javac Lab2.java
        If there's no output, that's a good thing; it worked.
 - Now you can run the actual program using the following command:
        
        java Lab2 Test1.txt

        Where "Test1.txt" is the fasta file containing the desired gene sequence.

 - This should output the GC-Content percentage.
